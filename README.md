============

This is a website designed to teach sorting to new students.

It presents a deck of cards and has the participant sort it. Based on the algorithm currently selected, various moves will be registered as correct or incorrect.

There are three modes:

* Demo - This is merely to illustrate the concept of the sort. No input is required from the user.
* Assisted - A smaller set of features where all non-optimal moves are disabled. This helps drill the concept of how to sort really works.
* Manual - Most moves are enabled. A counter of operations and memory used are also keeping track to see if the user has sorted with optimality.

A variety of sorting algorithms are supported with new ones being added.
